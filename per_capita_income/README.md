#Per Capita Income for Tri-State

Henderson County, Kentucky belongs to the Evansville Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for purposes of the U.S. Census. Henderson's assignment to the Evansville MSA is due to its proximity and economic ties with the Evansville area. The same can be said of the only other Kentucky county, Webster County, that is included in the MSA.

For purposes of state and regional economic development, Henderson is assigned to the Green River Area Development District (GRADD). In this collection of exclusively Kentucky counties, Owensboro is the center of and largest county in the GRADD district. The GRADD offices are located in Daviess County.
