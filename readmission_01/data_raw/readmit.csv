"Medicare Readmission Penalties By Hospital, Year 5",,,,,,,,"Medicare will apply these readmissions penalties to reimbursements from Oct. 1, 2016, through Sept. 30, 2017, which is the 2017 federal fiscal year (FY2017). This chart shows the penalties for all five years of the program. Maryland hospitals were not penalized because the state has federal permission to set its own Medicare payment rules. Also exempt are certain cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals as well as hospitals dedicated to psychiatry, rehabilitation, long-term care and veterans. Medicare also did not levy penalties against hospitals that had too few cases to be fairly evaluated.",,,,,,,,"Republication Note: The readmission data in this story and charts is assembled, interpreted and analyzed by KHN using six files from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. KHNÕs data is free to republish and should be credited to Kaiser Health News or Kaiser Health News and the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",,,,,,,,KHNÕs republishing rules can be found here: http://khn.org/syndication/,,,,,,,,Source: Kaiser Health News and the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hospital Name,City,State,FY2013 (%),FY2014 (%),FY2015 (%),FY2016 (%),FY2017 (%),No. Yrs PenalizedALASKA NATIVE MEDICAL CENTER,ANCHORAGE,AK,0.23,0.45,0.49,0.34,0.23,5ALASKA REGIONAL HOSPITAL,ANCHORAGE,AK,0,0.01,0,0.57,1.19,3BARTLETT REGIONAL HOSPITAL,JUNEAU,AK,0,0,1.27,0.45,0.04,3CENTRAL PENINSULA GENERAL HOSPITAL,SOLDOTNA,AK,0.07,0.09,1.41,1.02,1.28,5FAIRBANKS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,FAIRBANKS,AK,0,0,0.07,0.13,0.08,3MAT-SU REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER,PALMER,AK,0.1,0.01,0.92,0.48,0.92,5PROVIDENCE ALASKA MEDICAL CENTER,ANCHORAGE,AK,0,0,0,0.12,0,1YUKON KUSKOKWIM DELTA REG HOSPITAL,BETHEL,AK,0.33,0.27,0,0,0,2ANDALUSIA REGIONAL HOSPITAL,ANDALUSIA,AL,0.59,0.33,0,0.14,0.36,4ATHENS-LIMESTONE HOSPITAL,ATHENS,AL,0.04,0,0.09,0.54,1.12,4ATMORE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL,ATMORE,AL,0.95,1.08,0.8,0.25,0.17,5BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER EAST,MONTGOMERY,AL,0.36,0.12,0.39,0.3,0.05,5BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER SOUTH,MONTGOMERY,AL,0.75,0.27,0.67,0.44,0.87,5BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER-PRINCETON,BIRMINGHAM,AL,0,0.26,0,0.24,0.62,3BIBB MEDICAL CENTER,CENTREVILLE,AL,0,0.05,0.39,0.48,0.67,4BROOKWOOD MEDICAL CENTER,BIRMINGHAM,AL,0,0.04,0.35,0.62,1.26,4BRYAN W.
